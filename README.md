# Data Structure and Algorithem - Disjoint Set and Mazing 

# Disjoint Set
 
 The disjoint set ADT S is a set of non-empty sets = {S1, S2, S3...Sk} where no member of Si exist in any other set Sj,where i != j. 
 That is, Si and Sj have no members in common. Each set has an unique identifying member called the representative. 
 
# Mazing 
  
  Based on the disjoint set, a maze can be created. The mazing the an recursive algorithem that finds a path in a maze.
